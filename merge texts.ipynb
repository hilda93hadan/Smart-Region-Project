realize this vision by balancing innovation with stewardship indys vision will achieve the best individual mobility for residents both economically and in terms of transportation connecting our systems of transportation communications emergency services and data will enable the city to maximize resources make smarter investments and attract talent indy has long been at the forefront of transportation innovation we built the first union railroad station in the nation the indy  which celebrates th running this year was started as a testing ground for automotive innovation with technologies like front wheel drive seat belts and alternative fuel research coming out of the race its founder carl fisher conceived of the lincoln highway one of the earliest transcontinental highways built in the nation highways have always been important with indy having been the intersection of the national road and the dixie highway and today being connected by more interstate highways than any other city in the nation more recently indy set the bar for urban trails with our indianapolis cultural trail an mile bicycle and pedestrian network downtown lined with public art streetscaping and linking our cultural districts destinations and regional trails we also set the bar for modern airports building the only new airport since  to continued acclaim the city is putting the finishing touches on its rebuildindy program a  million infrastructure investment initiative that repaved streets added bike lanes and greenway trails and rebuilt bridges through a publicprivate partnership north americas largest allelectric car share program blueindy is open and expanding and soon indy will build americas first electric busrapid transit ebrt time and time again indy has been at the forefront of transportation innovation and the management of significant public infrastructure investments and with the help of smart cities well deliver again technology has revolutionized the way we travel and manage city infrastructure from the advent of vehicledetecting traffic signals to realtime crowdsourced gps systems innovations have enhanced user experience and improved system

manage travel demand the smart corridor model will use pilot corridors including the planned electricbus rapid transit network downtown arterial grid and major commuting arterial streets as sites for  indianapolis smart corridorspage   integrated transportation technologies the base of this system requires the installation and support of information and communications technologies ict and dynamic analytics using a cloudbased platform available in realtime this model will provide a feedback loop where realtime traffic information motivates transportation choice maximizes the capacity of our existing infrastructure and helps government and community leaders plan for and evaluate transportation investments the smart corridor objectives are to reduce congestion improve air quality and safety and enhance mobility through  system optimization using connected signs signals and raised pavement ledlight markers similar to inroads and monitors operators will be able to remotely program infrastructure to accommodate congestion manage emergencies and redirect overflow traffic to priority corridors  improved safety and ontime performance installing the infrastructure for users to

incentives  dynamic pricing building a base audience and capital reserve through major employers indy will provide transportation savings accounts to app users accessible through the internet to implement congestion pricing incentivizing transit biking and walking based on realtime traffic flow information made possible through cloud computing  element  commercial integration of autonomous and connected vehicle technology indianapolis is unique as the only city in the united states that stands ready to automate transportation systems in a clean and sustainable approach indianapolis offers and is developing an electric transportation system including blueindy an allelectric carshare service and the ebrt redline combined these systems are the result of more than  million invested in their initial phases electrifying the citys vehicle fleet alone has saved over  gallons of gas and will contribute to indys goal of becoming a resilient city by reducing oil demand and emissions through congestion reduction vehicle efficiency and managing electric demand urban automation requires a variety of testing environments which are captured by the following subprojects and as defined by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa levels of automation subproject  automation of redline ebrt system set for early  the nations first allelectric brt ebrt red line is an ideal platform to model automation for public transit the indianapolis smart city initiative would identify and finance the support and infrastructure needed to implement and operate a fully automated and electric red line advantages to automating allelectric brt  buses will operate in a dedicated lane lane divider lines or physical barriers  the smart corridor will include sophisticated its which could be leveraged for vi communication that will improve autonomous technology performance  provide smoother ride for users that is competitive with light rail systems  improve safety along an active dense multimodal corridor subproject  automation of blueindy route from the airport to downtown the second subproject would be automating a high frequency route of the blueindy electric car sharing service from the airport to a set station in indianapolis downtown central  indianapolis smart corridorspage   business district the vision is to automate a set number of blueindy cars to at least nhtsa level  which would allow drivers to experience a high level of autonomous driving while they travel from the airport to downtown the initial blueindy autonomous drive cycle will include a mix of highway and urban roads that will showcase the various benefits of autonomous technology like lane change control at high speeds as well as selfparking and speed control in dense urban areas advantages to automating all electric car sharing blueindy blueindy cars operate in a nodal network on largely set routes station to station seamless technology integration cars are connected and equipped with gps and advanced wireless telematics that allows vehicles to be remotely monitored the vehicles charging stations rental kiosks telematics systems and even insurance are all in place and owned and operated by bollor group so there will be fewer technology integration and legal liability challenges the bollor group has been a very cooperative automotive oem for the city of indianapolis subproject  airport shuttle automation the airport shuttle automation project would be focused on an immediate implementation of a nhtsa level  automation commercial project established and set up in a controlled protected and safe commercial environment the goal of this project would be to implement a fully autonomous shuttle system using electric buses in a closed loop environment the indianapolis international airport currently uses fossil fuelpowered buses to move travelers between the airport to the remote parking lots as well as the many shipping and distribution centers surrounding the airport the parking shuttles operate in fixed routes through the parking lots while the shipping companies like fedex which has its second largest us hub in indianapolis move goods between the airport and its distribution centers subproject  blueindy vehicletogrid vg plans for implementing vg are part of the blueindy contract with the city of indianapolis and the telematics and data collection necessary for vg are already in place this required plan will allow us to use smart corridors to eventually deploy a smart grid infrastructure that integrates ict information with the grid to sense and intelligently act on realtime energy flow information leveraging this study would lay the groundwork for launching the blueindy system into the portfolio of assets for indianapolis power  light iplaes supply and demand management activities as well as peak loading conditions to expand on the grid frequency regulation gfrvg project concepts in indianapolis the blueindy car share system provides ideal conditions for implementing a gfr and vg systems the  electric car share vehicles in the blueindy system total a potential of  megawatt hours of storage capacity a percentage of this energy storage ie  percent  percent etc can provide a high level of readiness for bidirectional flow of energy to the electrical grid private electric vehicle users of the vg technology would be able to receive credits to their transportation savings account through the app described in element  implementation and operation on the red line project moving from nhtsa level  to nhtsa level  automation will need to be phased in order to ensure safety reduce financial risk and optimize service delivery in order to meet the automation goals of the red line technology deployment for full automation will be phased to meet the standards of the usdot indygo and technology partners  indianapolis smart corridorspage   one drawback to brt is the ease with which level boarding can be implemented the proposed guidance technology in the first phase of this project will improve service delivery an example of this technology was recently tested on the emx brt system in eugene oregon transportation challenge addressed automation could directly address the recent dot estimates in combined cost of over  trillion per year lost through automotive vehicle crashes  billion per year urban congestion  billion wasted fuel  billion gallons  cost and ghgs and time  billion hours traffic delay per year the citys investments have already saved  mco and blueindys fleet logged  trips if vg electric car users could take advantage of dynamic pricing and save money electric vehicle use could grow exponentially these incentives could make car ownership possible for residents who previously could not afford it innovations in engineering its and automobile design have continued to reduce severe injury and fatality crashes across the nation despite these controls vehicles continue to be the leading cause of death for our young people ages  and  in indianapolis the situation for pedestrians is especially dire recently identified as a fhwa focus city due to disproportionately high rate of bicycle and pedestrian fatalities the number of pedestrian fatalities rose significantly from  to  indianapolis pedestrian crash statistics   the proposed smart corridors are among the  largest most travelled or highest crash corridors  for all users where everyone could most benefits   from improved safety through automatic braking  and other connected vehicle technologies potentially reducing crashes by  percent  a smart corridor where users vehicles and  infrastructure interface to warn users or respond to movement will be added to indys arsenal of traditional safety measures like improved sidewalk infrastructure lowering design speed and installing crosswalks and pedestrian cues  element  its architecture and realtime data integration the exponential growth of on demand mobility options like uber and lyft have revolutionized not only how people travel but how they access plan and pay for transportation the idea of transportation as solely brick and mortar is dissolving and users and operators depend on our invisible infrastructure for their daily travel needs its is the foundation of smart corridors that optimize personal mobility and engage residents while maximizing overall person throughput the system would create a live transportation model for managing travel demand that utilizes user data and intelligent infrastructure the feedback loop from user data and intelligent infrastructure would allow operators to remotely control traffic operations using its technologies like signal timing led lane striping and signs   usdot smart cities challenge forum afternoon breakout group  december  centers for disease control and prevention leading cause of death and nhtsa quick facts   aries portal  httpswwwariesportalcomvcrssearchwizardaspxrefresh  usdot beyond traffic trends and choices      indianapolis smart corridorspage   operators could remotely control traffic operations and dynamic pricing using its technology like signal timing led lane striping signs and the mobile application indianapolis smart corridors differ because they can serve as testing grounds for new its equipment and to establish best practices for pairing existing infrastructure and technologies implementation and operation there are a variety of investments needed to integrate advanced its and big data into realtime traffic management using a cloud computing system  the smart corridors will require a sophisticated ict platform and significant investment in its hardware this pilot will upgrade indianapolis th century its infrastructure and require a transportation management center tmc and staff capable of achieving the desired data and operating system integration the tmc will connect indots tmc and local emergency service and operations providers congestion management will initially require an excellent timing schedule based on established traffic patterns accounting for time of day and eventually integrate realtime information into the traffic management center using these base models the connected infrastructure will learn how to autonomously adapt to traffic movement smart corridors will require monitoring and sophisticated data management and storage systems currently traffic monitoring and remote programming is limited on the local network indiana department of transportation indot operates a humaninloop system that allows realtime response and will be an excellent example and resource transportation challenge addressed while the growth of traffic congestion continues to be a major concern for freight and passenger transportation nationally it is not the primary challenge in central indiana in fact in  the tomtom traffic index ranked indianapolis the th most congested city in america behind many of its peer cities including columbus ohio minneapolis minn denver colo and nashville tenn  indianapolis smart corridorspage   with a congestion level at  percent indianapolis does stand out from many of its peers in an important way the majority of our congestion is disproportionately experienced on local roads  percent versus highways  percent while nationally vehicle miles traveled vmt on local roads is outpacing freeway travel which has been declining since  in indianapolis significant congestion occurs on the local system because we are an event town from the super bowl to the ncaa basketball tournament regional and national conferences indiana black expo and other events we welcome an estimated  million visitors annually moving large amounts of people in and out of the downtown is important from a security economic and user perspective however transportation management approaches remain lacking strategies during these events range from additional police to roadway closures offramp and state road signal timing is on a time of day control coordinated with indys department of public works dpw and indot who owns and maintains it to manage events and rush hour traffic realtime its coordination is limited by summer  only  of indys  traffic signals will be connected by fiber optics these strategies are no longer possible as downtown indianapolis is evolving from an event location or evening destination to a neighborhood since  over  residential units have been completed with a total investment of about  million in the city big data and its offer a promising solution to managing congestion improving air quality and improving safety origin destination information from the user application could predict travel behaviors and adjust pricing accordingly and realtime data collections will provide information for operators planners and the public as pressure on the local system grows the capital for maintenance operations and construction have remained level or declined realtime data and pricing could provide a new direction in the financing planning and construction of transportation investments smart corridors will help indys inclusive goal by building regional assets for residents by providing free public wifi along these corridors including the brt network residents will be able to connect to more resources the recently completed alternatives analysis report for the red line corridor notes that within a walking distance of the stations there were  lowincome households  of which did not own an automobile over  section  units and two major public housing complexes are also within this walking threshold this project will connect these residents and more to information technology and mobility choices  element  user portalmobile application development in indy favors automobile use  percent of people drive to work with  percent of them driving alone to decrease vmt emissions and improve health outcomes we need to increase multimodal options and their density making these options accessible and seamless is a key strategy for realizing mode shift and helps indy meet its goals of a connected healthy and inclusive city the user interface will allow users to safely access transportation and connect to the city we envision an ondemand mobility service that enhances personal mobility by integrating all available travel options under a united payment platform   tomtom international bv httpwwwtomtomcomenustrafficindexlist texas transportation institute  urban mobility scorecard  visit indy httpwwwvisitindycom  us census bureau  american community survey year estimates    indianapolis smart corridorspage   smart corridor app mockup showing various options for the user to choose with other user preferences and incentives from multimodal platforms  the application will reduce congestion by providing economic incentives to providers and users through a transportation savings account similar to health savings account with employer or enrollee contributions users traveling from point ab will be able to see realtime traffic and incidents mode choices etc while receiving offers to take an alternate modes or routes to relieve congestion on the overall system key functions of the application include  integrated mode choice and trip chaining capability  unified payment platform and cellphone enabled payment  user reportingcrowdsourced data capture  dynamic pricing captured through a transportation savings account  dynamic routing and realtime availability implementation and operation multiple technology platforms are expanding into mobility app space like ridescout and metropias our research partner from human centered computing in the iu school of informatics and computing will lead the user experience and user interface elements for the smart corridor the smart corridor app may include modifications to existing platforms or the development of a new open source model that can be maintained and improved by the private sector important to the features and functionality of the app is tailoring the data collection and processing to inform transportation security planning and operations allowing users and operators to view realtime data and engage will create the synergy needed for innovative transportation management other features could include community information for current locations like median housing costs schools etc  advertising opportunities could be a substantial part of the financial sustainability for app maintenance transportation challenge addressed smart cities mean connected engaged citizens while transportation choices and operators are quickly multiplying public awareness and access to these options can be invisible people are unable to evaluate the competitiveness of each mode and make choices based on what is best for their overall needs the smart corridor app makes mobility seamless accessible and offers incentives for those who live carfree or are transit dependent helping indy become more inclusive the platform allows user reported safety concerns to inform investments and improve response times this information will be integrated into our asset management program and help prioritize investments by engaging and connecting our residents around the infrastructure that supports them we improve mobility for everyone the app catalyzes the growth of ridesharing or carlite options and will improving air quality by reducing emissions for the region  indianapolis smart corridorspage    element  live modeling traffic modeling and dynamic trip pricing dynamic pricing is a method to allow market forces to respond to peaks and valleys in supply or demand for a product or service each industry takes a slightly different approach to repricing based on its needs and the demand for the product similar to the octopus model in hong kong indianapolis will use dynamic pricing across the transportation sector to reduce congestion and more efficiently use our transportation system the user app will connect to a transportation savings account tsa that provides economic incentives for trips that lower emissions like ridesharing electric vehicles or bicycling since transportation demand exceeds funding and without a system of toll collection we have little opportunity to directly use dynamic pricing in the traditional sense therefore we propose to focus on two proxies through the user app  transit and parking  which will be expanded to include all modes after initial deployment dynamic pricing in parking has recently made waves based on pioneering work on onstreet parking by donald shoup indianapolis proposes to employ this model of dynamic pricing across the downtown area for both the onstreet parking as well as the privately owned parking garages the goal is to manage demand on our roadways the partnership with private garages will allow parking costs across all of downtown to fluctuate with time into and out of the garage encouraging drivers to travel at nonpeak hours whenever possible in the larger context of an entire transportation system transit is better equipped to handle large spikes in demand than most other modes of transport and cities should encourage as much travel as possible be made by transit during peak hours therefore indianapolis is proposing to incentivize transit travel during those peak periods by lowering the cost of the fare for example a regular bus fare may be  each way but if a rider boards during the peak time frame the fare is only  users will be incentivized to use different modes by providing discounted rates in the future this pricing model could track the true costs or estimates of infrastructure to users using data analytics from multiple agencies to aid in datadriven decision making when planning or evaluating projects the city could evaluate this use and cost data to help prioritize investments  this mockup highlights the menu on the left and color coded realtime traffic scenario the same image can show bike routes blueindy car parkingcharging stations etc  indianapolis smart corridorspage   synergies lead to datadriven decisionmaking and smart investments the smart corridor user application would incentivize routing based on mode and provide a captive audience or optimal modal mix for new technologies can vehicle throughput be maximized if all variables are controlled signals flow etc is separated bicycle infrastructure alone the best investment for reducing bicycle crashes or does connected vehicle technology vi need to be installed to maximize its benefits in a corridor with real time information on personal experience dynamic pricing happiness based on social mediauser experience survey travel time existing conditions traffic travel demand behaviors crash information infrastructure costsimpact budget expenditure infrastructure life cycle maintenance and operations costs environmental impact air quality emissions and infrastructure wear how will the public choose how to travel implementation and operation clearly this transit incentive program would result in lost revenue for the transit agency however the pairing of the parking and transit programs would allow the additional fees collected for peak hour parking to be used to offset the lost revenue to the transit agency making the overall program sustainable this program would require a significant investment in sensors to monitor realtime demand communications systems to notify drivers and users of changing costs and sophisticated fare collection systems for both parking garages and the transit fleet this smart cities grant would be used to build out that infrastructure necessary to implement the plan we will develop the dynamic pricing model using regression analysis as such a model can establish relationship between predictors such as distance traffic patterns and predicting the response variable the average fare at a given time one possible approach would be to use multiple linear regression model yb bx bnxni where y is the predicted fare at a given time b is the base fare and b through bn represent coefficients of predictor variables that are chosen such as distance traffic demand etc and in order to tie in the mission of promoting a smart city we could include a negative coefficient on a variables that indicate the level of environmental preservation dynamic pricing offers exciting opportunities to test behavior travel patterns and emission reduction strategies the system could support the expansion of carpooling through the central indiana regional transportation authority cirta by implementing choice recommendations from deloitte universitys smart mobility report like providing financial incentivize for carpooling providers or ondemand commercial providers to increase their number of shared rides data could lead to infrastructure investments that support ridesharing like hov lanes along smart corridors or reserving prime parking to incentivize cleaner transportation options indianapolis will update its zoning code to allow and support shared transportation facilities on public and private property to remove institutional barriers that discourage ondemand and shared mobility services and use   viechnicki dr

transportation gap and economic mobility the usdot identified indianapolis as a pilot site for the ladderstep program the red line brt investment will connect thousands of job and residents and serve as a building block for improving the economic mobility of residents ladderstep serves to catalyze construction and focus on building connections workforce capacity and supporting revitalization smart corridors would build on this effort by supporting mobility options while providing discounted fare during peak commuting hours working with employers to establish tsas and increase shared mobility choices smart corridors will provide greater access to economic opportunity to residents next to housing transportation costs are often the second highest cost burden placed on an average household in indianapolis the housing and transportation costs for most residents are  percent of their income by supporting the sharing economy and diversifying trip options through open source data and policy incentives we are improving mobility for all city of indianapolis residents this model could allow the city to set and price vmt reduction goals once patterns are established on the cost of emission reduction and individual choice   indianapolis characteristics of a usdot smart city  indianapolis is a consolidated citycounty with a  population estimate of  residents however portions of the county are known as excluded cities and retain substantial political and administrative powers and the portion of the population in indianapolis proper known as indianapolis city balance in census terms is estimated at  unlike many of its rustbelt peers indianapolis continues to grow and has done so throughout its history    the center for neighborhood technologys housing and transportation ht affordability index us census bureau httpquickfactscensusgovqfdstateshtml  us census bureau httpquickfactscensusgovqfdstateshtml     indianapolis smart corridorspage   this growth can largely be attributed to the citycounty consolidation which captured four decades of population and tax base growth while indy has grown consolidation disguised the disinvestment and abandonment of the urban core known as center township which has lost  of its population since the peak in  the exciting opportunity is like many cities indys urban core is on the rebound according to census figures over the past six years center township has grown for the first time since  and the most urbanized portions of central indiana all of which are in indy are the only places growing faster since  than they were before on the economic front the national decline in manufacturing hit indy later than many cities since  indy lost nearly  manufacturing jobs stripping many families and entire neighborhoods of their economic purpose recent research from harvards equality of opportunity project shows indy ranks  among the largest  american cities in terms of economic mobility and research from the brookings institute showing that the indy metro area has seen an  increase in poverty one of the fastest growth rates in the nation as accessible jobs left neighborhoods new jobs have emerged much farther away meaning families typically take a pay cut for a lowerlevel job while increasing transportation costs just to get there this is one reason the us dot selected indy to participate in the ladders of opportunity program ladderstep and why indy city leaders have focused and continue to do so in this application in promoting more robust transportation choices that improve residents access to economic opportunities throughout the region in  marion county accounted for just  percent of the regions population growth but over the course of the next ten years marion county consistently captured an everincreasing share rising to  percent of the metropolitan areas growth in  these trends mirror those that have been observed in other highlycompetitive metropolitan areas over the last  years weve had more than  billion in investment in downtown   other smart city characteristics indianapolis smart city infrastructure in the spirit of indianapolis successful history of largescale infrastructure improvements and economic investments indygo is currently pursuing the red line rapid transit project the red line will be the first allelectric brt in the nation and the first rapid transit service in indiana the complete line is envisioned as a mile brt corridor to be completed in three phases first of which is in the indianapolis regional center downtown and vicinity the red line will serve as the backbone to the planned regional transit network connecting neighborhoods from all walks of life universities and other major commercial hubs through the downtown urban core of the city while operating in its own lane along a dedicated route with traffic control technologies and frequent stops this ebrt system is ideal for developing autonomous vehicle technologies    more challenges to economic mobility in indiana httpiiwfblogspotcommorechallengestoeconomicmobilityinhtml  the growth and spread of concentrated poverty httpwwwbrookingseduresearchinteractives concentratedpovertym   indianapolis smart corridorspage   indianapolis has been at the forefront of the transportation electrification movement for a number of years energy systems network esn a nonprofit organization headquartered in indianapolis has been focused on accelerating the energy technology sector since  when it launched an initiative called project plugin esn gathered partners from a variety of industries and backgrounds to work together to begin a deployment of electric vehicle and smart grid technologies in central indiana using this approach project plugin launched nearly  charging stations in central indiana by  those initial deployment efforts led to the growth in electrified transportation detailed below in early  the city of indianapolis contracted with french multinational conglomerate the bollor group to provide and build out a fully electric car sharing service in indianapolis launched publicly in september  the system has accrued over  members in the first four months of operation and logged more than  trips with  operable stations the system will continue to build out through  and will finish with a planned  stations five charging stations each and  cars for a total of  charging stations capable of  mwh of storage in  the city of indianapolis entered into an agreement to deploy up to  plugin sedans in the citys fleet replacing older less efficient gasonly vehicles today there are more than  plugin cars deployed giving the city of indianapolis one of the largest fleets of plugin vehicles in the nation each car is saving the city approximately  per year in avoided fuel and maintenance costs this has resulted in over  gallons of gasoline and  mtco saved further savings can be gained by utilizing automated safety systems on the vehicles to reduce chances of accidents as well as leveraging the large cumulative energy storage capacity of the vehicles as a whole through a holistic integrated systems approach with the grid and built environment an environment conducive to smart corridors the red line is one part of a significant rethinking of what an indianapolis transit system should be and demonstrates how indys environment is conducive to implementing the smart corridor project for over five years the indianapolis region has been working on a transit vision dubbed indy connect in early  indygo will be unveiling the first step in indy connect a fiveyear implementation plan to improve the transit system in the core city of indianapolis this plan would be put to the public as a referendum in november  this planning process has deliberately made the choice of deploying new resources into areas of highest density and ridership potential rather than attempting to cover more area key components of the plan include red blue and purple rapid transit lines and significantly enhanced local service with more frequency improved travel time and extended night and weekend hours  indianapolis smart corridorspage   committed leadership  indys leadership is committed to smart corridors and long term strategies for improving the region as plan  demonstrated smart corridors is informed by plan  a pioneering planning process to define the next century for the city that has been driven by an extraordinary team of nearly  community leaders the plan is a collaboration between the greater indianapolis progress committee department of metropolitan development dmd dpw the indy chamber and community leaders to make indianapolis a better place to live work and visit the plan  initiative includes a visionary yet strategic bicentennial plan for indianapolis as well as updates to six local government plans commitment to smarter land use  affordable housing indys ability to maximize transportation investments has been the key to the success of many large scale projects indygos red line brt system will connect hundreds of thousands of jobs and community members to maximize this investment and housing security for all residents along the route the city is adopting transit oriented development tod overlays to support appropriate land use zoning and development  indianapolis smart corridorspage   the tod strategic plan produced by the indianapolis metropolitan planning organization mpo supports community development that includes a mixture of housing office retail and city living amenities integrated into a walkable neighborhood and located within a halfmile of quality public transportation to increase accessibility to jobs this year the city will expand on both of these efforts developing a neighborhood housing strategy for the entire county that uses datadriven inputs to coordinate public nonprofit philanthropic and private sector community development investment as well as a new countywide land use plan that includes a focus on increasing density in select villages introducing transitoriented development and connecting land use recommendations to adequate public infrastructure this work will ultimately set the stage for new mixeduse district zoning categories provided by indys new zoning ordinance indyrezone similar to many us metropolitans indys existing transportation infrastructure requires greater investment capital than the operation and maintenance budget will allow in spite of this indianapolis continues to spend less per capita

the information and communications technology and services supply chain as president trumps executive order put it while this naturally prevents any us hardware company from selling components  such as chips that may be used in g networking equipment  to huawei the world soon realized the ban also applies to software google revealed that to comply with the trade restrictions it would have to stop providing huawei with support for android and googles services this will have some impact on existing huawei devices but the real e ect will be felt on future huawei devices as they wont be able to o

reportedly forced manufacturers to preinstall certain google apps on android devices this led the alphabet subsidiary to completely rework its licensing model for android in europe instead charging device makers a fee to preinstall its apps  including youtube google maps and gmail  while o ering them google play chrome and search under separate licenses earlier this year google also started suggesting browser and search engine alternatives for android users in europe android remains intact for now but such measures set the groundwork for what has been a gradual unbundling of android in

still patchy at best  and there is a reason google opened up android auto so that it works straight from a mobile phone screen undeterred google two years ago launched android automotive an operating

our collaboration with microsoft we are introducing the most powerful and farreaching connected vehicle platform said kal mos global vp of alliance connected vehicles at renaultnissanmitsubishi leveraging the size and scale of the alliance we have built an intelligent cloud platform that sets the pace for our industry so while carmakers have shown some willingness to embrace android google has not met the resounding welcome it may have hoped for there may be a number of reasons carmakers are hesitant to hand over the keys to their infotainment systems but chief among them could be a reluctance to cede control of monetizable data and services to google this resistance has popped up elsewhere in the automotive sphere with companies pushing to ensure they retain full control over their incar services the likes of ford and toyota joined forces a couple of years back to launch the smartdevicelink sdl consortium which supports open source software deployment for cars and in  a

did nothing to help android wears chances of survival despite subsequent rumors that samsung would perhaps switch back to googles androidbased software now called wear os it has steadfastly stuck with tizen similarly samsung has never embraced android tv instead using its own samsung smart tv platform before switching entirely to tizen a few years ago as an aside lg has sought its own smart tv path in the form of webos which it acquired in  but rival smartphone companies face considerable challenges as they try to forge a path outside of googles android huawei has made up ground against samsung

amazon has attempted to go it alone in the mobile phone realm back in  it launched its fire phone as it sought to build on its burgeoning fire tablet lineup amazons fire devices are based on android but they use a forked version that sidesteps google play services to provide a direct artery into amazons ecosystem  amazon has made a success of its fire tablet though not without some friction with google particularly as budgetfriendly devices for families it has also succeeded with its firebranded settop boxes and dongles by contrast its fire phone barely lasted a year before it was culled in part because it lacked a comprehensive pool of apps including googles  fork in the road huawei will undoubtedly have to launch its own operating system something it has been preparing for a while the system will probably be based on android so it can support the millions of android apps out there but huawei will need to do a better job than amazon of getting third parties to put their apps in its

native apps such as maps gmail or youtube and because the us trade ban doesnt only implicate google other usbased service providers such as facebook and twitter likely wont be available through this store either so google is still in a strong position from an android perspective but the aforementioned factors  ranging from eu regulation to us trade blacklists  could eventually take their toll also other phone makers will look at huaweis predicament and recognize that the same thing could happen to them chinese companies in particular will observe recent events with caution but it could serve as an impetus for companies such as samsung to push ahead with e orts to escape googles stranglehold the impact such shifts would have on consumers isnt clear  the last thing the world needs is more fragmentation with countless android forks app stores and more if googles version of android brings anything its consistency of access across devices it would actually make a great deal of sense for all the big handset makers to form a consortium and develop their own android fork andor app store that works across their respective devices that would go some way toward freeing them from their reliance on google while encouraging app developers to join in but that isnt likely to happen anytime soon  for starters samsung and others probably dont want to align themselves with huawei but make

internetconnected devices and even autonomous cars by anthony schoettle indianapolis business journal indianapolis  the latest buzzword in mobile is g  the newest generation of wireless service that immediately promises more speed and better connectivity for smartphones internetconnected devices and even autonomous cars but g is about more than speed experts call it a transformational technology that could eventually mean unprecedented battery life for devices think a month before charging your smartphone and lag times shorter than the blink of an eye making videoconferencing as good as

wireless advantage  click here to purchase photos from this gallery and nowhere in the country will g be more available than it will be soon in indianapolis where both verizon and atampt  which have the nations two largest wireless networks  are rolling out the technology by years end verizon however is phasing in g  starting with residential wireless before expanding to mobile not only from a technological standpoint but from a public relations perspective this is a really big deal said david love a professor of electrical and computer engineering at purdue university it tells you that indianapolis is being mentioned in the same breath as austin the bay area and other tech epicenters he said this is enormously important for the city of indianapolis and the state in fact houston is the only other city in the country that will have g service from atampt and verizon this year love said the early rollouts will help the metro area recruit talent and new business  especially in the tech sector people and businesses definitely take notice of these types of developments love said its big news the g in g stands for generation  as in generation of wireless technology and with each generation new capabilities have emerged in the s the first generation allowed mobile phone calls for the first time without a rare and expensive satellite phone in the s g allowed text messages in  g allowed voice text messaging and email as well as some web browsing and apps in  g allowed video on mobile and other devices  which gave rise to the popularity of services such as youtube the others

wwwtherepubliccomearlygrolloutinindianapolisgivescitywirelessadvantage      early g rollout in indianapolis gives city wireless advantage  even imagined yet cooperation officials at atampt and verizon say it wasnt a hard decision to bring the technology to indianapolis thanks in part to the attitudes of local and state officials policymakers in indiana have been working on reform to make this possible for more than a decade said atampt indiana president bill soards indiana has the right policies in place and the cooperation of various government agencies has been extremely helpful in bringing this new technology to market state lawmakers even penned legislation this spring limiting municipalities ability to stifle the infrastructure needed for g service the groundwork for g was laid in  when thenlt gov sue ellspermann formed the indiana rural broadband working group said state sen jim merritt rindianapolis the legislature also passed measures in recent years to make wireless service more available statewide and to grease the skids for evolving technology huge investment the concept behind g is that small cells that are closer together and closer to users result in faster and more reliable service but the investment is huge which means wireless companies are choosy about where theyre spending their initial outlays verizon works with the indycar series where its a title sponsor and at lucas oil stadium where it was a key wireless provider during the  super bowl those experiences helped verizon executives become familiar with local government officials and their willingness to get things done for businesses that has given the company the confidence to invest  million in this market since  granby said which helped pave the way for g  wwwtherepubliccomearlygrolloutinindianapolisgivescitywirelessadvantage      early g rollout in indianapolis gives city wireless advantage  the infrastructure in indianapolis is worldclass he said that has given rise to a burgeoning tech ecosystem and that coupled with the way government bodies work with businesses and each other made this the right place to make this investment atampt has invested  million in indianapolis and  billion in indiana since  according to company officials the advantage tech experts said of getting g this year from two major providers goes beyond just optics while atampt and verizon along with a handful of other providers will begin rolling out g in earnest next year blanketing the entire country could take many years each generation  whether g g or ghas taken a decade to roll out said indiana iot lab founder john wechsler indianapolis will be getting g in a matter of months there are some markets  major markets  that wont have g for a number of years and maybe quite a few years so the advantage here is real atampt earlier this year announced that  cities will get its g mobile service this year verizon announced only four cities  los angeles houston sacramento and indianapolis  will get its stationary g residential service this year tech experts said verizon will no doubt hurry to get its g for mobile users deployed  like atampt has  and indianapolis will likely be an early market really speaking at ibms think  conference this spring verizon ceo lowell mcadam dropped this bomb by the way in an iot setting g will have year battery life and we expect that in a mobile phone environment youll probably charge your phone once a month thats right mcadam said a cell phone that now needs a charge every  hours would need a charge every  days in a g world and he added that devices connecting via g could be ridiculously thin capacity frustrations could also soon be a thing of the past

type of early development assures that were not just consumers of a new technology but that wre a player in this realm and that helps build a thriving tech ecosystem the path so far only indianapolis

advocates and organizations who collaborated to create the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness a set of longterm solutions that fundamentally address the needs of our most vulnerable neighbors over the last several years our communitys efforts to prevent and end homelessness in indianapolis have reached unprecedented levels and yet despite this work reported numbers indicate that our community has continued to see the prevalence of homelessness rise over the last decade our approach to ending homelessness can no longer stop with simply providing temporary shelter or transitional housing we must increase affordable housing and supportive services so that the most vulnerable members of our community have a place to call home the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness is our most transformative and ambitious plan to date providing the types of systematic reforms necessary to take a truly collaborative approach to end homeless in indianapolis anchored by strategies to reduce the length of time people experience homelessness increase availability and accessibility to safe supportive and permanent housing increase housing stability and prevent returns to homelessness and prevent people from being released into homelessness the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness will serve as a catalyst to developing real solutions for this urgent need thank you for your commitment to these shared community priorities we believe that homelessness can and must be solved in indianapolis and we know that by coming together as one community  faith leaders business professionals social services professionals public servants and individual citizens  we can prioritize our resources to do just that we look forward to continuing to work together in ensuring that all indianapolis residents are housed and connected to care sincerely  joe hogsett  alan witchey mayor city of indianapolisexecutive director coalition for homelessness intervention  prevention  we must increase affordable housing and services so that the most vulnerable members of our community have a place to call home    indianapolis community plan to end homelessness  on any given night in the city of indianapolis nearly of the continuum of care to increasing permanent  of our most vulnerable neighbors are experiencing housing options homelessness  they are sleeping in temporary shelters  the reuben engagement center opened in january transitional housing or on the street in a community that  providing a safe place for homeless individuals is nationally recognized as a leader in sports entertainment experiencing drug or alcohol intoxication who are unable serves as the midwest hub for technology innovation and to gain access to emergency shelter due to their active prides itself on hoosier hospitality we believe that we can substance use the center provides these individuals and must do more to help families and individuals who with initial medical monitoring for withdraw symptoms experience homelessness referrals for mental health and substance abuse treatment recovery housing and case management since the inception of the first blueprint to end homelessness in  community leaders and advocates  system performance measures were established and have committed to taking a shared approach to ending regularly monitored so we can better track our goals homelessness in indianapolis blueprint  which toward ending homelessness guided the communitys work from  to make homelessness rare shortlived and recoverable resulted  a coordinated entry system was successfully launched in several key milestones including in july  providing a common application process assessment prioritization and referral to housing  a community governance structure organized around resulting in more efficient use of resources based on the blueprint council with the coalition for homelessness vulnerability and severity of need intervention and prevention chip serving as the support entity began significant systemchange efforts including  in  the indianapolis housing agency created its first focusing on special populations like veterans and those ever homeless preference offering subsidies through the experiencing chronic homelessness changing the coordinated entry system community funding process and shifting the focus   while these efforts have helped indianapolis to make great strides forward we continue to face many challenges t  he majority of services available to individuals and families facing homelessness are designed to meet immediate needs with temporary solutions leaving gaps in services focused on obtaining and maintaining stable housing  t  he current inventory of safe affordable housing dedicated to permanent supportive housing or rapid rehousing is too low to meet our citys demands  f  or those who do obtain housing we do not have the support systems in place to provide consistent access to mental health services interventions for substance use disorder or to meet other longterm needs that would ensure overall wellbeing and longterm selfsufficiency  w  hile many service providers are working to address these gaps efforts often take a fragmented approach without building the coordination or collective funding strategies to support longterm success as we look to the future for indianapolis we know that we must be prepared to rise to the challenge and address these critical issues the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness is an ambitious yet clear plan to drive solutions for our city anchored by a simple concept we believe everyone has the right to be housed and connected to care by focusing first and foremost on  creating a surge of safe and affordable housing options in indianapolis the plan calls on the business community government representatives and community advocates to reimagine our approach so that we can meet shared goals for the community by meeting the goals outlined in this plan indianapolis will see radical changes over the next five years by  not only will we have ample affordable housing options throughout the city we will also have a functioning system that effectively connects individuals and families experiencing homelessness to these safe affordable housing options by  any individual or family in indianapolis who becomes homeless will spend no more than  days without a permanent safe affordable place to live no one who loses their job or experiences domestic violence will have to choose between the safety of themselves and their children and having a secure place to stay no one will be released from a hospital the criminal justice system or the foster care system without a place to call home and because we know that securing housing is just the first step toward longterm stability everyone in our city will have continual access to care that meets their mental physical social environmental and economic needs so that once they are housed they can stay housed for the longterm by working together to make these transformative changes a reality in indianapolis we can and will solve this citywide issue ensuring that everyone has a place to call home    defining homelessness we recognize that homelessness can be defined in many different ways depending on program guidelines or federal funding restrictions in fact locally veterans programs schools reentry programs and the department of housing and urban development hud funded continuum of care grantees all operate within the continuum of care using different definitions however we recognize that limiting our shared definition of homelessness to align with any of these specific guidelines would exclude critical organizations and strategies needed for the success of this plan moreover some funding streams that restrict the definition of homelessness can even limit housing to people who are living in places not meant for human habitation emergency shelters or transitional housing or those who are exiting from an institution where they temporarily resided for  days or less therefore for the purposes of the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness homelessness will be defined as any family or individual that lacks regular fixed and adequate nighttime residence  by using this definition strategies in the plan are designed to support all unaccompanied minors and families who are unstably housed and likely to continue in that state as well as families or individuals who face losing their primary nighttime residence within  days without the resources or support networks necessary to remain housed the plan also considers those who are fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence or trafficking situations who lack resources or support networks to obtain other permanent housing further the plan includes individuals who entered into correctional institutions and treatment programs and lack resources or support networks to secure or maintain housing upon exit while this inclusive definition supports our community vision that everyone deserves to be housed and connected to care it is important to note that this inclusive definition within the plan will not change how indianapolis collects data for the annual pointintime count nor will it change federal funding restrictions for program eligibility however adopting this inclusive definition will create shared ownership of meeting unfunded needs and encourage the community to seek less restrictive funds  special populations the majority of this plan focuses on strategies that affect people of all walks of life who are experiencing homelessness however the community understands that specific populations who face homelessness can experience unique challenges that require more tailored  chronically homeless  veterans  solutions to account for these unique challenges the plan also highlights unique goals and strategies for those who are chronically homeless veterans youth and young adults and families  families  youth and young adults  our vision drawing on evidencebased practices community members agreed on the key vision and values that will guide the oversight and implementation of this plan prioritizing the increase of safe affordable housing as a clear focus for ending homelessness in indianapolis will be the foundation for the plan yet service providers government representatives and businesses alike acknowledge that an increase in housing alone will not address the complexity of needs barriers and systemic challenges that individuals and families experiencing   homelessness often face input from a variety of community partners and those experiencing homelessness firsthand confirms that providing access to holistic systems of care designed to address mental physical social environmental and economic needs is just as critical as increasing the availability of housing as we build effective solutions to homelessness these clear communitydriven concepts shape the vision for the indianapolis community plan to end homelessness we believe everyone has the right to be housed and connected to care  on any given night in the city of indianapolis nearly  of our most vulnerable neighbors are experiencing homelessness  our values as we realize this vision together community

longstanding disabilities and injuries that are exacerbated due to the prolonged length of time living on the streets or in areas unfit for habitation because of the complex health needs associated

homelessness without resulting in longterm housing solutions indianapolis has committed to ending chronic homelessness by creating a surge in housing that is accessible to people experiencing chronic

the use of strong measurement and a focus on outcomes as a means to measure our communitys success by examining key system performance measures utilized by department of housing  urban development hud and the data from the system modeling report completed in  key data points were identified and included as success measures in the plan under each strategic priority baseline annual targets and a fiveyear goal were created strategic priority  measures an individual or familys length of time homeless in emergency shelter transitional housing and safe haven this is a hud system performance measure which assesses the communitys crisis response system and our ability to help individuals quickly move from crisis to stable permanent housing by focusing on driving down the length of time individuals and families spend in crisis housing we are encouraging a more effective community response to homelessness strategic priority  measure the number of permanent supportive housing units and rapid rehousing subsidy slots that has been identified as needed to adequately address homelessness for key segments of our community in this planning process the community prioritized the creation of an inventory of permanent housing that could end chronic homelessness among individuals and end veteran homelessness the secondary priorities for the community focus on increasing the availability of permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing for families as well as for youth and young adults the number of units of permanent housing needed were identified from the system modeling report completed by abt associates strategic priority  measures the number of individuals and families who did not return to homelessness upon exiting to a permanent housing destination this is also a hud system performance measure and was seen as a correlating measure to the effectiveness of the services and case management provided to homeless individuals and families this measure examines all types of interventions in the overall community and assesses our communitys ability to ensure that individuals and families are connected to sufficient resources and supports so that they can remain in their permanent housing this includes individuals who are receiving temporary or ongoing assistance to obtain and maintain housing and it also includes individuals who were able to exit to permanent housing without financial assistance but may have received services and case management from community partners in regards to the population specific measures for housing retention it should be noted that only programs dedicated to serving that population were assessed in their population goals goals for strategies priorities  and  were identified based upon community feedback and the capacity for continuous and accurate measurement of our community capacity to    address homelessness strategic priority  will eventually have annual targets and a fiveyear performance goal related to data integration after we have sufficient information from those projects to establish them strategic priority  is the development of new funding and those targets will be set as part of the initial operationalization of the plan the year housing goal for chronic homelessness utilizes indianapolis system modeling which assumes  of the permanent supportive housing inventory turns over each year and is available for new moveins annual benchmarks for achieving this goal account for housing at least  of individuals experiencing chronic homelessness per year the year housing goal for veterans utilizes indianapolis system modeling which indicate that the rapid rehousing inventory must be sufficient to serve at least  veteran households with approximately  months of assistance annually and must also have sufficient resources to end chronic homelessness the number of available permanent supportive housing units as noted in the goals and benchmarks for this population includes the number of units that are made available annually due to turnover or new units according to system modeling the indianapolis community has sufficient resources for rapid rehousing but the eligibility for some veterans to r eceive services will need to be assessed the need for rapid rehousing should be assessed annually as the number of homeless veterans decreases for youth and young adults permanent supportive housing units are nationally recognized as nontime limited supportive housing while this plan focuses on youth and young adults ranging from age  due to housing eligibility the community recognizes the urgency of addressing the comprehensive needs of unaccompanied youth from age  as well as youth who meet the department of educations definition of homeless therefore strategies for addressing these needs are included in a supplementary youth and young adults operational plan data in the youth and young adult plan may change as updated youth system modeling data becomes available the year housing goal for families utilizes indianapolis system modeling adapted from a threeyear model to a fiveyear model to align with the fiveyear period of this plan it will be necessary to assess the need using ces data and adjust projections as necessary annual benchmarks for achieving the year permanent supportive housing goal for families assumes  of units will be attained annually it is also important to note that as communitywide data collection efforts improve and additional institutions and partners participate the baseline data included in the plan will become more accurate as more information becomes available the data related to each priority area within the plan should be continually evaluated  appendix d  sources external reports  comparative plans  collective impact

resilience engaging your community through data  cisco blog  cisco blog  government government share  urban resilience engaging your community through data kenn dodson march      comment  a resilient city needs resilient people but how does that happen is it organic or does it require a little push and what role should technology play in creating resilience the truth is that growing a smarter more resilient city requires rapid and transparent interaction between government and the people and that means increasing community engagement by bringing more citizens and more data into the governance process what is resilience  resilience for a city sometimes called urban resilience means its people businesses government institutionseven daily processeshave the capabilities to survive adapt and grow in the face of continual stresses and intense shocks for cities like my hometown of indianapolis resilience initially meant being prepared to handle both physical blizzards tornadoes and economic loss of a massive manufacturing base shocks but as economies rebounded and populations grew it became clear new stressesthe burdens of success so to speak also needed attention to me resilience goes one step further ideally it would include a thorough blending of technology processes and culture with culture being much more important than you might think but the culture of the city cannot be mandated by law it can only be powered by the people and that means building a solid process for community engagement how to increase community engagement httpsblogsciscocomgovernmentfirststepstoresilientcitiescommunityengagementandkinetic      urban resilience engaging your community through data  cisco blog  my hometown of indianapolis has done a great job increasing community engagement and addressing citizen needs through a total revamp of its myindygov digital city hall httpsmyindygov plus a variety of other technologies my general feeling is that merging new technologies and approaches such as gaming apps and a citizen engagement lab with traditional outreach methods like neighborhood meetings design charrettes and walkabouts may be the best way to increase community engagement and should be a citys first step to share resiliency you can start building a culture of resilience in your own town by increasing opportunities for citizen engagement including developing an easytouse digital city hall paired with a mobile app to empower citizens with access to the same data that city agencies vendors and other organizations do

technology meant to save energy and money be dangerous and invade your privacy one indianapolis woman was wondering so she came to iteam  for answers our viewer who asked us to use her nickname jr initially came to us worried the new smart meters might be a fire hazard but as we began to investigate we learned shes not the only one with those concerns and there are cybersecurity concerns as well jr first learned about the smart meter in a pamphlet that came with her regular power bill from indianapolis power and light they stated that they would be putting in a smart meter jr said she got on the internet to learn more about smart meters also known as ami or advanced metering infrastructure what she saw scared her reports of the meters causing fires im just a regular average american and i work hard for what i have said jr i dont want my house to burn down its old but its still my home iteam  started digging the indiana department of homeland security division of fire and building safety had no data on smart meters the us fire administration does not collect data that differentiates between smart meters and traditional meters however the us consumer product and safety commission had  reports about smart meters the reports are generated by consumers who go online and make a report so its impossible to say if the problems are valid of the  reports nine were about fires and eight were about electricity issues i think we should be safe i think everything in our homes should be safe nothing should cause fires jr said those werent the only concerns we found others are worried not about the physical safety of smart meters but the cybersecurity the security flaws that can exist in the smart meters can in fact be many said larry pesce a sans certified instructor pesce is a penetration tester  which means he acts like a hacker and with permission exposes cybersecurity issues he found out how hackers can get into a smart meter and what info they might be able to get they could take your power offline pesce said theres a possibility given a really determined attacker that they could take lots of peoples power offline he said they can also how muchnewsletter power youre using and when your email sign up see for our httpswwwwishtvcomnewsiteamaresmartmeterssafeandsecure  subscribe       are smart meters safe and secure ive seen some research that they can even tell what was being shown on your tv said pesce  if someone can tell how much power youre using they can figure out when you might be out of the house possibly giving them an opportunity to break in or commit other crimes but pesce himself has a smart meter and says the amount of time and effort it would take to hack in would probably not be worth it iteam  took these concerns to ipl to see what theyre doing to keep your home safe our ipl field technicians that are out there servicing the meters we have trained them and they know how to identify the signs that might indicate that there is meter damage or there could be meter damage said clarie dalton a spokesperson with ipl they are confident youll be safe and say the new smart meters might even be more safe than the meters on homes right now with this ami technology were able to see if it could melt or if something like that could happen so were able to mitigate that issue almost immediately said dalton we can monitor for heat damage through ami technology ipl said all the data coming from the smart meters is encrypted and does not contain any identifying information still jr wants to be able to choose if she gets a smart meter we heard that customers want an optout program and thats something that we dont offer but we are really confident in the technology that were utilizing dalton said ipl has no plans to let customers optout in the future according to the edison foundation there are more than  million americans with smart meters and more than half a million of those here in indiana if you still have

indianapolis naloxone data is driving policy building a social service response  indianapolisnaloxonedataisdrivingpolicybuildingasocialserviceresponsepdf opioid abuse is a national epidemic some  million people abuse prescription pain relievers and  use heroin according to the american society of addiction medicine httpwwwasamorgdocsdefaultsourceadvocacyopioidaddictiondiseasefactsfigurespdf there were more than  deaths related to painkiller abuse in  and almost  heroin overdoses technology leaders in indianapolis have been using information to attack the problem since  and have lately become increasingly sophisticated in how they apply data science to combat the scourge data is how you know whether something is really a problem or whether it is just a blip said tom arkins chief of it and informatics with indianapolis emergency medical services iems the citys ambulance service if we have five incidents in a day and no more for a month thats a blip but when you have five every day for a month thats a trend the trend in this case  and iems big data breakthrough  involves naloxone an emergency medication used to check the effects of a potentially fatal opioid overdose we had been hearing anecdotal reports from our crews that we were using a lot more naloxone and i wanted to dig in and see what was really going on arkins said crews aboard the citys  ambulances record any time the drug is given so the data was already available and the anecdotes turned out to be correct from doling out  doses in  the citys emergency medical teams had ramped up to dispense more than  doses in  and  is on the same trajectory with  doses administered by late march the data has helped the city to better organize its resources from a budgetary perspective we can plan to have a greater supply of this so we dont run short arkins said a databased approach also allows emergency medical personnel to coordinate their efforts more closely with law enforcement in an effort to address the addiction at ground level httpswwwgovtechcomdatahowindianapolisnaloxonedataisdrivingpolicybuildingasocialserviceresponsehtml      how indianapolis naloxone data is driving policy building a social service response  we started looking at it geographically to see what parts of the city were having problems arkins said with our data we can see down to the actual address so we know there is a certain hotel where there is a problem there are certain blocks that are problems we cant give the police an actual address because of hipaa health insurance portability and accountability act concerns but we can aggregate it and make a heat map to show an area iems now produces a monthly map and is looking to develop a realtime tool the ambulances data reporting systems dont attach geographic coordinates to incidents that information has to be coded manually which slows down production of maps arkins team is exploring various offtheshelf software tools that would allow it to geocode on the fly in order to streamline production of maps which in turn could facilitate more effective law enforcement efforts the data has helped to drive bigpicture changes as well spurred in part by iems reporting the state legislature last year passed a law that empowers police and fire crews to administer naloxone even before the arrival of medical personnel on scene in addition to teaming with emergency responders from other agencies iems has leveraged its data to forge partnerships with the social service community now every time somebody gets a dose of naloxone a message goes to the social workers and that triggers them to go to the hospital to start the followup process with that patient arkins said iems has been building up that capacity over the past year its about actually getting to people at the moment of impact we want the social worker to get to them when everything is still fresh in terms of what just happened to them health officials also have begun to drill down more deeply into the data in search of other avenues to address the crisis in so doing they noticed that about  percent of patients who receive the counternarcotic will get it more than once it tells us that there is a small subset of people who are having a larger problem and so we want to think about how to target those people arkins said demographic data also has surfaced that could help to drive policy around the issue it turns out  percent of people who get naloxone are from the local county while  percent come from out of county and  percent from out of state httpswwwgovtechcomdatahowindianapolisnaloxonedataisdrivingpolicybuildingasocialserviceresponsehtml      how indianapolis naloxone data is driving policy building a social service response  where are these people coming from is there a way we can feed that information back to those police departments and those jurisdictions so they can look at it alongside what they are already seeing arkins said this is epidemic across the entire country and everyones data can contribute to the solution while the data has helped to move the needle  engaging law enforcements driving policy building a social service response  arkins says that such an approach must be handled with some care in a complex landscape subtle cues can be easy to miss suppose police see a cool spot in a heat map of heroin activity one might suppose thats an area without a problem  but it could be an indicator of a zone where a drug dealer operates you have to look at the whole picture he said you cant just look at what you are seeing on the surface because there may be something else there that is telling you an important part of the story nor should medical services be looking at the data alone the information may originate with ambulance crews but an effective use of the data requires multiple sets of eyes this is not an ems problem this is not a police department problem he said this is a city of indianapolis

local code for america fellows to gather data and build the portal and on nov  the city posted three new data sets to the site information on police complaints useofforce incidents and of cerinvolved shootings is now all freely available previously it was only accessible via a public records request when we had our launch day you could see the level of trust was increased just by the fact that the city and the police department were willing to share this data lori white executive director of the citys citizens police complaint of ce and the projects manager told statescoop it shows people that the department is no longer saying thats all con dential information the effort is part of a larger regional push to open up government data but white said the city put a special focus on sharing police information thanks to code for americas involvement in the white houses police data initiative but the nonpro ts fellows began working with the city on the police data project as soon as they arrived last october  months before the white house program was announced it hadtoalways been the experience mayors of across ce wasall really interested in looking at said chris reade one of the fellows we use cookies provide yousomething with the best scoop news group websites got it and a news software developer foryou theconsent projectto we prettylearn broadmore access to the public safety department and a pretty by using scoop group websites thewere use given of cookies httpsstatescoopcomindianapolislaunchesopendataportalpoliceencounters      indianapolis launches open data portal for police incidents  broad mandate to nd problems to solve  subscribe  the fellows and white consulted with police and concerned citizens and selected three data sets to release based on how frequently the data was requested white said the process of collecting the relevant data was a relatively easy one  her of ce already shares software with the department that records information on police incidents reade said that meant everything made a lot of sense internally once the fellows got a chance to review it but they did still had to work to make the data machine readable the fellows and white also had to decide what if any information about the various incidents to withhold ultimately they set up a system that holds data for about a month before posting it and shields the names of complainants and of cers as well as the addresses where incidents take place we dont want to send somebody to somebodys home just because we share the data white said the public indicated they were most interested in gleaning information about trends from the data with that in mind the fellows conducted some initial analyses of the data that they eventually posted on the portal as well sometimes we get in our own little lane and we dont see what the other lanes in the city are doing white said if weve got a quick and easy way to pop open that portal and see what kind of animal complaint cases are being activated that would tell the police maybe theres something going on there laura ellena one of the fellows and a user researcher for the project said shes already heard from the police about how that broader look at the data is helping them we know already the impd was able to identify a trend where an of cer had complaints of a similar nature and say hey this is something that were seeing multiple incidents lets create an intervention and work to improve things based on the data ellena said in the coming weeks and months white said the city will consider adding more data sets to the portal to promote that kind of internal evaluation with information on assaults on of cers a likely addition in the near future whatever the city chooses to release next white said it will go a long way toward improving transparency its just reasonable to believe that our local governments and eventually hopefully the federal government will get into the realm of heres all our data you can

techpoint  who are passionate about using public data to create datadriven twenty rst century government while the open indy brigade has only been working towards civic innovation since  the modern data movement began with the opening of federal data in  under the obama administration the position of federal chief information o cer was created and federal data covering a treasure trove of topics such as public safety nance climate education and more became available on datagov datagov was designed to provide raw data with tools and resources that allow citizens to research create innovative applications and promote the design of data visualizations an inspired group of technology and design professionals founded code for america to address the gap between the public and private sectors in their use of technology code for america which has grown into a national network of civic innovators created a platform for civic hacking through brigades like open indy brigade all around the country who meet regularly to encourage the use of technology design and open data in their local governments  the  indy civic hack focused on mass transit issues in indianapolis  open indy brigade is a code for america a liate participating heavily in the annual indy civic hack in partnership with the indy chamber matt kirby senior consultant at ksm consulting and member of the open indy brigade organized the rst indy civic hack in  it was an eye opening experience it encouraged the indy tech community to engage folks at the city and state level to start to educate citizens on what open data was said kirby fast forward to  and the open indy brigade is essential in connecting the winning hackers with people and companies that can help them make their ideas a reality httpstechpointorgopengovernmentdataindyopenbrigadeknows      open indy brigade is passionate about public data  techpoint  all three winning teams in this years indy civic hack included participants from techpoints talent programs including xtern xtern bootcamp and indyx tech fellowship  concerning the open indy brigades posthack e orts kirby says there are really two components to it the challenge with the college students who participate is that they arent equipped to continue that process after the hack their ideas are half baked but we can help to move them forward and the challenge with state government is that it is not wellequipped to engage a startup like one that comes out of a hackathon in the procurement process we work with these agencies to improve how they can work with nontraditional vendors open indy brigades goal is to continue the work to improve the community and while they speak heavily to the importance of civic hackathons moving forward they want to work to involve more members of the community their big push to accomplish this is the indy idea hub an extended collaborative hackathon that will allow volunteer project teams to identify develop and pitch civic technology solutions over a three month period by removing the time constraints and competitive environment of a traditional hackathon the indy idea hub will enable larger more diverse teams to work in concert and deliver an end product more likely to achieve implementation the indy idea hub is currently accepting submissions for projects and the top three concepts will be announced at their meetup on august  at the new downtown indianapolis speak easy  httpstechpointorgopengovernmentdataindyopenbrigadeknows      open indy brigade is passionate about public data  techpoint  open

indianapolis has the potential to become a leader in smartcities projects officials said and it  recently won a grant competition from the virginiabased smart cities council that will give leaders the tools and expertise to scale up their efforts indianapolis is really good at taking a vision thats aspirational and meeting it said former mayor stephen goldsmith director of the innovations in american government program at harvard universitys kennedy school of government think amateur sports what we havent quite done is paint a picture of how important this goal is to the future positioning of the city goldsmith said once thats accomplished and the case is made indianapolis always responds this is the future but the city is already behind some competitors as indianapolis starts learning what it means to be a smart city other midsize metro areasincluding columbus ohio kansas city missouri and san diegoare moving at breakneck speed its not just a trend its a race said jesse berst founder and chairman of the smart cities council which bills itself as a network of companies universities and other bodies that acts as a neutral adviser to cities theres fierce competition for early research and jobs berst said theres some major economic development benefits but also environmental benefits youre going to have a better time if you get in the race early what makes a city smart depends on whom you ask the smart cities council describes a smart city as having digital technology embedded across all city functions but admits the concept is still in the knowitwheniseeit phase others describe it as building intelligent infrastructure regardless of the definition capitalizing on the data a community already hasand tearing down barriers so it can be shared among departments and examined in different waysis a big part of the concept the data is where the gold is berst said the concept is manifesting itself differently across the country columbus winner of the us department of transportations smart cities challengehas more than  million in public and private resources to invest in intelligent transportation systems including streetlights that are hubs for wireless internet connection driverless shuttles electricvehicle charging and parkingmanagement services san diego has deployed  sensors on its streetlights allowing them to direct drivers into open parking spaces help police during emergencies track carbon emissions and more httpswebarchiveorgwebhttpswwwibjcomarticlesindylookstodatatofindsmartanswerstobigproblems      indy

corridor smarter complete with kiosks for people to learn about transportation entertainment and city servicesand to receive emergency alerts indianapolis is just starting to define the concept for itself ken clark the citys chief information officer said projects are being judged based on how well they can strengthen neighborhoods reduce poverty and help the city with fiscal solvency its not about every light doing something cool clark said but is instead about how we can help people who need help in a way thats valuable to them making public safety and poverty reduction the centerpiece of it is the ideal indianapolis has roots in deploying the concept in lowertech ways goldsmith said but an explosion of connected devices and new tools for crunching data has opened up much more potential when goldsmith was a prosecutor in indianapolis he said his team used data to increase child support collections and indianapolis was a trailblazer in creating a website through which residents could take care of basic services but from a city hall perspective the last five years have been almost breathless he added you have mobile tools available cloud computing sensors meanwhile other indiana cities are making progress too south bend mayor pete buttigieg made headlines in  when that city upgraded its sewer system with  million worth of sensors and controls that allowed it to avoid a  million repair and the state is also hoping to make inroads in capitalizing on the power of big data this year the indiana general assembly codified the states management and performance hub as a state agency and funded it at  million per year the hub seeks to analyze various public data sets to enrich publicpolicy debates and help solve problems two big challenges officials are already tackling reducing indianas infantmortality rate and checking its opioid epidemic its not data for datas sake said mark lawrance indiana chamber of commerce vice president its data to help improve things the potential is great leaders say indianapolis reputation for cooperation among government the private sector and philanthropy increases its potential to lead in the smartcity field goldsmith said the citys big convention population is another asset he imagines an even more exciting downtown experience in which visitors are greeted with digital signage and wayfinding tools receive a mobile alert about a special exhibit while visiting a museum or have an app route them to the closest open parking space

million budget deficit we dream outside of our budget said katie robinson director of the office of sustainability so city officials say theyre trying to focus on projects that will have the most impact while realizing the effort is long term story continues below heres how indianapolis and its partners are employing smart technology and envisioning more uses  the impds real time data center located in the former eastgate shopping center was developed for the super bowl in  but is now used for daytoday operations ibj photoeric learned public safety police have gathered and employed data for decades but the indianapolis metropolitan police department is now making it work in a whole new way with predictive policing for example traditionally after a shooting a uniformed officer takes a report and an investigative unit comes to the scene to interview witnesses and victims then develops a reactive case said impd deputy chief of operations chad knecht but now impd is trying to predict the next shootingmaybe a revenge crimebefore it happens at impds realtime data center police are crunching data from security cameras and licenseplate readers to make links and analyze everyone that runs around with the victim suspect what cars theyve been known to be in what crimes theyve committed we can get in front of it if there are any retaliatory actions knecht said we can go to those locations and put additional traffic stops police presence were getting there before the offender and showing we are prepared to respond the data center was developed in  for that years super bowl in indianapolis but the city started using it for daytoday policing this january  httpswebarchiveorgwebhttpswwwibjcomarticlesindylookstodatatofindsmartanswerstobigproblems      to data to find smart answers to big problems    indianapolis business journal  ibjcom impd is also usingindy a looks socialdisorder indexa measurement of the amounts and types of  offenses recorded in a neighborhoodto try to prevent crimes in part by fixing underlying problems for instance police knocked on doors near east th and rural streets an area with a high socialdisorder index and asked residents what problems needed to be solved in their neighborhoods then the department worked with public and social service agencies to try to resolve the concerns before they led to crimes five months later the areas socialdisorder index was down  percent according to impd additional technology could analyze data to see early on whether activity that led to major crimes in the past is starting up again instead of just being reactive we can be proactive knecht said food deserts indianapolis fooddesert problem has been top of mind since hogsett took office and the pending closure of marsh grocery stores is exacerbating it but smartcities solutions could help the city is working with iupui to define the concept of a food desert specifically for indianapolis theres already a federal definition then city officials want to look at realtime metrics for possible solutions one key is trying to figure out the best places to offer incentives to get a grocery store or neighborhood market up and running and city officials think they could use mapping software and public transportation data to find better creative ways to connect people with fresh food it may not make as much of a difference that you live in a food desert as it does how you get to food said hope tribble director of the office of audit and performance water infrastructure theres also a fledgling partnership among the city its utilities and global water technologies that hopes to transform the citys water infrastructure the plan said global water technologies ceo erik hromadka is to create a wireless network near the  tech innovation district north of the iupui campus that would connect water meters gas meters and streetlights to showcase ways to use sensor technology to solve problems such as the citys aging underground water infrastructure the proposed network for example could leverage connected devicesthe internet of thingsto help make the distribution system more efficient improve customer service by providing better information reduce watermain breaks and even help with public safety hromadka said  httpswebarchiveorgwebhttpswwwibjcomarticlesindylookstodatatofindsmartanswerstobigproblems      indy looks to data to find smart answers to big problems    indianapolis business journal  ibjcom and having a system thats connected to other utilities means potential extra help during an  emergency if theres a fire run to the area you could have a streetlight that flashes as an indicator of the location hromadka said the global water technologies project currently has no timeline or budget government efficiency the city is revamping its website as another smartcities project dubbed shift indy but clark said the project is not about just redesign but also digitizing government processes behind the scenes that could mean installing kiosks and portals around the city to allow people without internet access to take care of basic government needs how do we help folks who dont have a car not to have to come here clark said from the th floor of the citycounty building downtown where we can were focused on creating a digitalcityhall concept the city also wants to equip its departments with management and performance data as a way to improve processes save money and reduce costs tribble said the city is working with bloomberg philanthropies whatworkscities initiative to make that happen the effort could include providing departments with dashboards to display performance data in a few areas such as calls that come into the mayors action center phone line and interactions at the department of business and neighborhood services formerly known as code enforcement its not just counting widgets like how many inspections we do but how do we improve tribble said how do we get better outcomes in our inspections how might we count the efficacy of those inspections and set goals maybe we can reduce the number of failures read more innovation issue stories
